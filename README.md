# Study Materials

This repository contains my study materials from various university courses, including:

- Notes
- Assignments
- Lab reports
- Code files

## üîó Large Files (Books / PDFs)

To keep the repository size minimal, some large files (like textbooks or reference PDFs) have been removed from Git history and uploaded externally.

Roy D. Yates, David J. Goodman - Probability and Stochastic Processes_ A Friendly Introduction for Ele.pdf

Course Books/ECA1/ECA Book Nilsson.pdf

These are books that you can find easily on the internet
